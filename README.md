# 🔐 Secured REST API Tutorial – JWT Authentication

## 📖 Overview

This project is a simple tutorial demonstrating how to **secure REST APIs using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.

It shows how:
- A user authenticates through a login endpoint
- A JWT token is generated after successful login
- Other services verify the token before allowing access to protected resources

The example uses **two services**:
1. **Authentication Service** – Generates JWT tokens  
2. **Service1** – A protected service that verifies JWT tokens
